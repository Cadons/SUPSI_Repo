<br />
i would love to think that i was some some kind of intellectual:
either the dumbest smart guy, or the smartest dumb guy. can't say i
can tell the difference. i love to talk about ideas and concepts. i
forge odd metaphors instead of reciting cliches. like the
simularities between a friend of mine's house and an underwater
salt mine. my favorite word is salt by the way (weird choice i
know). to me most things in life are better as metaphors. i seek to
make myself a little better everyday, in some productively lazy
way. got tired of tying my shoes. considered hiring a five year
old, but would probably have to tie both of our shoes... decided to
only wear leather shoes dress shoes.<br />

about you:<br />
<br />
you love to have really serious, really deep conversations about
really silly stuff. you have to be willing to snap me out of a
light hearted rant with a kiss. you don't have to be funny, but you
have to be able to make me laugh. you should be able to bend spoons
with your mind, and telepathically make me smile while i am still
at work. you should love life, and be cool with just letting the
wind blow. extra points for reading all this and guessing my
favorite video game (no hints given yet). and lastly you have a
good attention span.","currently working as an international agent for a freight

38,"thin","anything","socially","","graduated from masters program","i'm not ashamed of much, but writing public text on an online
dating site makes me pleasantly uncomfortable. i'll try to be as
earnest as possible in the noble endeavor of standing naked before
the world.<br />
<br />
i've lived in san francisco for 15 years, and both love it and find
myself frustrated with its deficits. lots of great friends and
acquaintances (which increases my apprehension to put anything on
this site), but i'm feeling like meeting some new people that
aren't just friends of friends. it's okay if you are a friend of a
friend too. chances are, if you make it through the complex
filtering process of multiple choice questions, lifestyle
statistics, photo scanning, and these indulgent blurbs of text
without moving quickly on to another search result, you are
probably already a cultural peer and at most 2 people removed. at
first, i thought i should say as little as possible here to avoid
you, but that seems silly.<br />
<br />
as far as culture goes, i'm definitely more on the weird side of
the spectrum, but i don't exactly wear it on my sleeve. once you
get me talking, it will probably become increasingly apparent that
while i'd like to think of myself as just like everybody else (and
by some definition i certainly am), most people don't see me that
way. that's fine with me. most of the people i find myself
gravitating towards are pretty weird themselves. you probably are
too.","i make nerdy software for musicians, artists, and experimenters to
indulge in their own weirdness, but i like to spend time away from
the computer when working on my artwork (which is typically more
concerned with group dynamics and communication, than with visual
form, objects, or technology). i also record and deejay dance,
noise, pop, and experimental music (most of which electronic or at
least studio based). besides these relatively ego driven
activities, i've been enjoying things like meditation and tai chi
to try and gently flirt with ego death.","improvising in different contexts. alternating between being
present and decidedly outside of a moment, or trying to hold both
at once. rambling intellectual conversations that hold said
conversations in contempt while seeking to find something that
transcends them. being critical while remaining generous. listening
to and using body language--often performed in caricature or large
gestures, if not outright interpretive dance. dry, dark, and
raunchy humor.","my large jaw and large glasses are the physical things people
comment on the most. when sufficiently stimulated, i have an
unmistakable cackle of a laugh. after that, it goes in more
directions than i care to describe right now. maybe i'll come back
to this.","okay this is where the cultural matrix gets so specific, it's like
being in the crosshairs.<br />
<br />
for what it's worth, i find myself reading more non-fiction than
fiction. it's usually some kind of philosophy, art, or science text
by silly authors such as ranciere, de certeau, bataille,
baudrillard, butler, stein, arendt, nietzche, zizek, etc. i'll
often throw in some weird new age or pop-psychology book in the mix
as well. as for fiction, i enjoy what little i've read of eco,
perec, wallace, bolao, dick, vonnegut, atwood, delilo, etc. when i
was young, i was a rabid asimov reader.<br />
<br />
directors i find myself drawn to are makavejev, kuchar, jodorowsky,
herzog, hara, klein, waters, verhoeven, ackerman, hitchcock, lang,
gorin, goddard, miike, ohbayashi, tarkovsky, sokurov, warhol, etc.
but i also like a good amount of ""trashy"" stuff. too much to
name.<br />
<br />
i definitely enjoy the character development that happens in long
form episodic television over the course of 10-100 episodes, which
a 1-2hr movie usually can't compete with. some of my recent tv
favorites are: breaking bad, the wire, dexter, true blood, the
prisoner, lost, fringe.<br />
<br />
a smattered sampling of the vast field of music i like and deejay:
art ensemble, sun ra, evan parker, lil wayne, dj funk, mr. fingers,
maurizio, rob hood, dan bell, james blake, nonesuch recordings,
omar souleyman, ethiopiques, fela kuti, john cage, meredith monk,
robert ashley, terry riley, yoko ono, merzbow, tom tom club, jit,
juke, bounce, hyphy, snap, crunk, b'more, kuduro, pop, noise, jazz,
techno, house, acid, new/no wave, (post)punk, etc.<br />
<br />
a few of the famous art/dance/theater folk that might locate my
sensibility: andy warhol, bruce nauman, yayoi kusama, louise
bourgeois, tino sehgal, george kuchar, michel duchamp, marina
abramovic, gelatin, carolee schneeman, gustav metzger, mike kelly,
mike smith, andrea fraser, gordon matta-clark, jerzy grotowski,
samuel beckett, antonin artaud, tadeusz kantor, anna halperin,
merce cunningham, etc. i'm clearly leaving out a younger generation
of contemporary artists, many of whom are friends.<br />

forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? this
works in the same way. if you are not consciously there to hear it,
see it, taste it, smell it, feel it none of this matters, it's
still there. pay attention to the little things, those that are
often overlooked. see if you can find the magic in this gift we
call life.","plotting to take over the world with my army of segway riding

28,"average","mostly anything","socially","never","graduated from college/university","i was born in wisconsin, grew up in iowa, and moved to california
three years ago for a combination of work opportunity and just
wanting to live in sf. it took me a couple years to get to the
peninsula, but i'm glad i eventually got here. i'm passionate about
people and have a wide variety of interests and talents.<br />
<br />
i'm also continually learning about myself. for example, i'm
learning very recently that as a result of spending all my time
growing up, in college, and for the last five years focusing on
growing my ""deep relationship"" skills, i'm not as good as i
previously thought at initializing friendships/relationships. i
guess that isn't all a bad thing since the ""first impression"" thing
only really happens once with each person. :)<br />
<br />
as a result, i love my friends, i've got a lot of deep friendships,
and know how much richer a friendship can get as it gets
deeper.<br />
<br />
i'm passionate about music, i play the guitar, write songs (less
now than before), write plays (more now than before), want to learn
french and asl, am pretty good for an amateur ballroom dancer, can
do almost everything moderately well (seriously, no joke), love
bright ties and shoes, am a jacket and jeans person, and absolutely
love figuring out how people tick. i think i'm pretty cool and wish
more people would be patient enough to take the time to see
that.<br />
<br />
every friend i've ever had say i'm nothing like anyone else. so i
don't come off like anyone else. i'm my own person. and i'm proud
of that.","i'm currently the youngest member on an internal strategy team for
a large bank. it may sound boring, but i'm a big fan of the
opportunities it entails. i get to be exposed to really
intelligent, deliberately organized people be purposeful in a high
paced business environment. it's pretty awesome soaking up all
their knowledge while contributing what i can.<br />
<br />
i'm happy with who i am and would enjoy adding someone else to the
mix.","i'm really good at a little bit of everything. there isn't much i
truly excel in, but i'm above average to good in almost every area.
i take pride in being able to do a lot of different things. for
example, i have a tiny bit of talent/skill in writing,
wood-carving, cooking, singing, playing a guitar, drawing, sewing,
etc. i grew up in a household that had to make a lot of the things
we needed, so you kind of picked up these things along the way.","the way i dress. some days it's hats, other days it's different
ties. most days it's shoes and jackets. just another way to express
myself.<br />
<br />
i've also decided that people notice how i'm not what they
expected. i find myself unpurposefully continually surprising
people, and i think i like that. :)","books = yes. avid reader.<br />
moves = eternal sunshine, vanilla sky, stranger than fiction,
garden state, lord of the rings, star wars (the classics),
etc<br />
tv = lost, himym, psych, big bang theory, etc<br />
music = brandi carlile, bon iver, band of horses, killers, etc -- i
have a seriously wide range of musical tastes, not because i don't
have taste but because i believe every genre has talented
musicians<br />
food = sushi, bbq, italian--i like trying things, but often find
myself coming back to the same old, same old","guitar - even if i don't play it all the time, i've got to have it
as an available outlet<br />
corrective lenses - bats can see better than me if i don't have my
glasses<br />
book - always reading--well, not as always as i used to, but still
enough that i feel naked without a book in my bag<br />
ipod - got to have my music; 11,000 songs and counting. :d<br />
car - i really don't like being stuck at home--i don't mind being a
homebody at times, but i don't like being forced to be<br />
money - i've found it's unbelievably hard to find fun things to do
without spending money if you don't want to stay at home","a little bit of everything. but mostly social influences and how
everybody's connected one way or another. there's a fascinating map
of humanity out there, and it's interesting learning how people are
influenced and how they influence.","hanging out with a small group of friends--staying in or going
out--and just enjoying their collective company.","i'm picky when it comes to dating. i know what i'm looking for and
won't waste my time. or hers.","if you know who you are, who you want, where your life is going.
also, i'm a genuine guy who isn't going to be like everyone else.

get to know someone, and are looking for the kind of guy you can
take home to your parents. :)","white",72,40000,"banking / financial / real estate","2012-05-22-17-05","daly city, california","","straight","likes cats","christianity and very serious about it","m","leo but it doesn&rsquo;t matter","no","english (fluently), sign language (poorly)","seeing someone"

louisiana). i do audio programming for video games, and just
started at a game studio out here. yes, i am a bit of a nerdy
programmer, but i don't have it stamped across my forehead - i
don't even really play video games all that often. i actually
create/play music way more often in my spare time.<br />
<br />
i'm starting a new life here in ca and really excited about it. i
only knew one person in this area when i moved here, but i wasn't
worried - i always make friends pretty quickly. in every city i've
lived, i've made at least a few life-long friends. i'm definitely
looking to do the same thing here.<br />
<br />
i'm a very easy to get along with kind of person. i always try to
avoid over-complication. i have no time for bullshit, and i would
expect the same from anyone i'm close to and/or respect.<br />
<br />
i'm very much into doing things outside and living a healthy/fit
lifestyle. i'm really looking forward to doing some camping,
backpacking, biking, etc in ca. i also really enjoy going out for a
nice meal and some tasty cocktails or beer, or doing the music
nightlife thing. i dj (drum n bass) from time to time, and i've
already landed a few gigs in the bay area. i'm very much involved
in dnb and other electronic genres, but i love live music just as
much.<br />
<br />
basically ... life, to me, is about working hard and playing hard.
i've made a lot of sacrifices and invested much effort to get
myself into an industry where those two can often overlap, which is
something i'm fairly proud of myself for. i've learned a lot of
cool stuff so far and i plan to continue doing that. i'm pretty
excited to see where that will take me :d","making music, programming, getting back into a fit lifestyle after
an extended stay in louisiana, exploring the new city i just moved
to.","i'm from louisiana, so cooking and eating are pretty much ingrained
into my dna. there's a drinking factor involved as well.","lately, i keep getting asked ""are you with the band?"" i'm also

somewhat vulgar flare (i hope you can take a joke-offensive or
not).<br />
<br />
i'm a constant seeker of discovering something new, whether it be a
different restaurant, culture, or music (anything really). i tend
to have an eclectic personality.<br />
<br />
i volunteer and participate with a lot of activities with my
community. i also tend to seek those who have a story, any story.
i'm all ears! i want to learn from you, hear what you have to say,
and relate it to my own personal experience.<br />
<br />
i'm a bit of a nerd and like to watch the history, military, and
discovery channel. something about militaristic strategies intrigue
me.<br />
<br />
i'm a bit of a tom boy, so i indulge in shooting guns, playing
video games, and working out consistently. i also have the guilty
pleasure of watching ridiculous comedy (family guy, curb your
enthusiasm, it's always sunny ...just to name a few)","i'm currently studying and majoring in criminal justice, and i will
be graduating soon :) (i'm stoked!). i have something lined up in
the future that is awaiting for me pending graduation (i'll tell
you later).<br />
<br />
i'm currently working on a difficult project with school, which has
me discovering different perspectives of san francisco's tenderloin
district. i'm chatting with homeless people, prostitutes, drug
addicts, and so far 1 ""john"". intereresting to say the least.","hmm...i know i can take a test rather well.;) ...ohh and i'm pretty
good at playing tic-tac-toe by myself. i win all the time!<br />
<br />
listening-people say that all the time, but i tend to think of this
as somewhat a necessity. listening to another human being.
tricky.<br />
<br />
lots? the one skill i prize in: i'm really good at reasoning and
rationally thinking. i find this to be extremely rare
nowadays.<br />
<br />
i'm really good at tinkering with things on the side, being that i
crave discovery and self knowledge, so in a sense i'm good at
figuring things out on my own.","physically-i've been told my eyes. people usually like how i can
turn a serious situation into something relaxing and fun. i tend to
make shy people ""talk"" to me...but i keep hearing that's a plus.","i'm much more of a movie goer. favorite actor: edward norton.
favorite actress : rachel weise. favorite director: darren
aronofsky . that should give you a pretty good idea of the type of
movies i like.<br />
<br />
i absolutely love to dance! nothing is a better stress reliever
than hitting the dance floor with good company.<br />
<br />
hands down though, my ultimate love affair with music is
essentially classic rock. the scorpions are absolutely my favorite
band because they bring a smile to my face every time i hear them.
they were also the best concert i've ever attended.<br />
<br />
best book i've read so far: the secrets of the fbi- by robert
kessler. if you were obsessed watching the sopranos, i highly
recommend this book!<br />

always has that homely feeling to it.","my cellphone<br />
