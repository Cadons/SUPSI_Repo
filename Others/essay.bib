  abstract = {Reverse engineering of program code is the process of constructing a higher level of abstraction of an implementation in order to facilitate the understanding of a software system. Reverse architecting code has been advocated to identify the current software architecture of existing software; to assess its quality, and to determine improvement areas. There are several reverse engineering tools built upon several methodologies for analyzing object oriented source code. These approaches are addressed and evaluated to focus on their capabilities with the aim of applying selection approaches to JAVA source code. A framework for software rearchitecting and rearchitecting tool support is proposed. Recommendations and remarks have been highlighted.},
